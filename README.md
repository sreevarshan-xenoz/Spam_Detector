# Spam Detector Using Naive Bayes Classifier

This project implements a spam detector using the Naive Bayes algorithm in Python. The goal is to create a spam filter that accurately classifies messages as spam or ham (non-spam) with an accuracy greater than 80%. The project serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques in text classification.

## Project Overview

In this project, we build a spam filter that can classify SMS messages. The Naive Bayes classifier is chosen for its effectiveness and simplicity in handling text data. The spam filter aims to help users avoid unwanted messages and enhance their messaging experience.

## Motivation

With the increasing volume of unsolicited messages (spam) that people receive daily, there is a growing need for effective spam detection systems. This project aims to provide a robust solution for classifying messages, making it easier for users to manage their communication and focus on important messages.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of 5,572 SMS messages collected from various sources. The dataset is available in CSV format, with two main columns:

- **label**: Indicates whether the message is "spam" or "ham".
- **message**: Contains the actual SMS message text.

### Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is a well-known public dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can download it from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

### Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of punctuation marks and conversion of all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting messages into individual words (tokens) for further analysis.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spam-detector
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`



pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib tk



Usage
Training the Model

To train the spam detector model, run the following command:

bash

python spam_detector.py

This script will:

    Load the dataset.
    Preprocess the data (cleaning and tokenization).
    Train the Naive Bayes model on the training set.
    Save both the model and vectorizer to disk as model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl, respectively.

Running the GUI

After training the model, you can run the graphical user interface (GUI) with:

bash

python gui.py

The GUI will allow you to:

    Input SMS messages.
    Check if the message is classified as spam or ham.
    View the classification results in a user-friendly format.


Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the spam filter, the following metrics are calculated:

    Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified messages.
    Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted spam messages to the total predicted spam messages.
    Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted spam messages to the total actual spam messages.
    F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The evaluation is conducted using a separate test set containing 1,114 messages that were not used during training. These metrics provide insights into the model's effectiveness and reliability.
Additional Features

The project can be enhanced with the following features:

    User Feedback Loop: Allow users to provide feedback on the classification results to improve model accuracy over time.
    Multi-language Support: Extend the functionality to classify messages in different languages.
    Detailed Reporting: Generate reports on the number of spam vs. ham messages and the model's performance metrics.

Results

Upon evaluation, the spam detector achieved an accuracy of over 98%, indicating that it can effectively distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. The model's performance was validated on the test set, revealing that out of 1,114 messages, only 14 were misclassified.

These results highlight the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes classifier in handling text classification tasks and its potential for real-world applications in spam detection.
